Bootcamp study guide materials

## Description
This is a prework study guide made for myself, a bootcamp student. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. My motivation to create this project is based in the desire to be the best student I can be. I built this study guide so that I could set myself up for success and have a user freindly place to find all of the information that I learned in this bootcamp. Anytime I come across a problem, I can reference my study guide to try to find a solution.

## Usage 
To use this Prework Study Guide, you can sort through the notes for each section and challenge yourself by attempting to recall information before looking at the notes. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Control+Shift+I for a Windows computer, use Command+Option+I for macOS. A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first. From there you can follow along with the topic and study the bullet points. Happy studying!
